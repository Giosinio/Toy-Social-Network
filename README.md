# Toy-Social-Network
Hi :>
Welcome to my Toy Social Network application. In order to use the app properly:
  I included in the repository a copy of the database(dbexport.pgsql) with which I worked during the project development
  You should have installed PostgreSQL in order to use this app and extract the content of the dbexport.pgsql there
  To run the app, go to Main class and run it from there
